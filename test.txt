Hi,

I am Zoe, a level four computer science major student. My macid is ningh4. As the 2021 fall term is getting closer, I have some questions about course enrolment and CO-OP.

On the course detail pages on Mosaic, building names and classroom numbers are given under the "room" section for some courses. Does this mean that these courses are only available for students attend in person? Can students retrieve lecture recordings online?

As a level four student, my expected graduation time is April 2022. If I receive an offer before graduation, can I get the Honours CO-OP degree even if the CO-OP starts in May 2022 or later? If so, does the CO-OP have any influence to my graduation?

Zoe
